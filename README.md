### **ðŸš— introducing the gas fund....**

hackathons are incredibly special. we ([Hack Club](https://hackclub.com/)) want more people to be able to go to hackathons.

this school year, we'll fund the cost of gas for you (or a parent) to drive to [any hackathon in the USA or Canada](https://hackathons.hackclub.com/). we'll alternatively reimburse you the equivalent of that if you buy a train or bus ticket.

here's how it works:

1.  join the [Hack Club Slack](https://hackclub.com/slack).
2.  post the word gas in the `#gas-fund` channel
3.  we'll reach out and, if you're good to go, we'll send a link for you to submit receipts!
4.  send us a photo of you at the hackathon alongside your receipts, and we'll reimburse you via direct deposit or a cheque.

we're offsetting all related carbon emissions through funding a collection of Gold Standard-certified projects. **are you a hackathon organiser?** let's work together to get more people to your hackathon, reach out to [hackathons@hackclub.com](mailto:hackathons@hackclub.com).
